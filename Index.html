              <h2>Bio</h2>
              <p> As someone who is actively pursuing a career in software development, I am always eager to learn and grow in my field. While I am still developing my skills, I am passionate about the power of technology and its potential to solve complex problems and create engaging user experiences. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through a course at Columbia University, and I am determined to continue honing my skills in these areas.

              While I am still gaining experience in the field, I believe that clear communication and collaboration are key to the success of any software development project. I am always open to feedback and eager to work with other developers to bring new ideas to life. I understand that I still have much to learn, but I am committed to growth and improvement, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.
                
              I would be honored to have the opportunity to bring my passion and drive to your software development team. I am confident that I have much to offer, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a software developer.
